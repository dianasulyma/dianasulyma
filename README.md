### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Diana  

Iâ€™m a masterâ€™s student in Data Science with background in criminology and psychology. My current research focuses on **quantifying AI trustworthiness**.  

Recently, I implemented **parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)** on a large language model trained for **medical expertise** â€” available on Hugging Face:  
[DoctorGPT-FineTuned](https://huggingface.co/Deanna/doctorgpt-ft)  

This repo includes projects on:
- **Machine learning** for forecasting
- **Computer vision** exploration on projects in object detection and region of interest extraction  
- **Natural language processing (NLP)** and domain adaptation  
- Occasional creative explorations 

Open to collaborating on projects!
