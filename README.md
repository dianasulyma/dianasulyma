#### Hi there,  
ðŸ‘‹ My name is Diana, and I'm currently a master student in data science at Carleton University. I have a background in criminology and psychology.  

ðŸ“˜ I'm currently developing a method for measuring AI's trustworthiness. I hope to turn this into my thesis topic. 

ðŸ©» Recently, I implemented parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) on a large language model (LLM). The model has been fine-tuned for medical domain expertise and is now available on Hugging Face: [DoctorGPT-FineTuned](https://huggingface.co/Deanna/doctorgpt-ft).
