My name is Diana, and I am a Data Science Student at Carleton University. I host my personal projects here.

ðŸ“˜ Iâ€™m currently learning about privacy preserving techniques in ML such as differencial privacy, machine unlearning, and federated learning.   

ðŸ©» Recently implemented parameter-efficient-fine0tuning (PEFT) on an LLM. Model was fine-tuned on medical domain expertise, and is available on HuggingFace: https://huggingface.co/Deanna/doctorgpt-ft.
