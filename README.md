#### Hi there, 
My name is Diana, and I am a Data Science Student at Carleton University. I host my personal machine learning projects here.

🌱 I’m currently learning about privacy preserving techniques like differencial privacy, machine unlearning, and federated learning.   

👨‍💻 All of my projects are available at: [https://github.com/DianaRogachova](https://github.com/DianaRogachova).
