#### Hi there,  
👋  My name is Diana, and I'm a master student in data science at Carleton University. I have a background in criminology and psychology. 

💡  All projects on here are for personal skills and educational development (and for fun).  

📘  Currently, I'm developing a method for measuring AI's trustworthiness. I hope to turn this into my thesis topic. 

🩻  Recently, I implemented parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) on a large language model (LLM). The model has been fine-tuned on medical domain expertise and is now available on Hugging Face: [DoctorGPT-FineTuned](https://huggingface.co/Deanna/doctorgpt-ft).
